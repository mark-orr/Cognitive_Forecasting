README for /Users/biocomplexity/Projects/SocioCognitiveModeling/Metaculus_CogModeling/sandbox

file1.py:
    Beta for time to peak prior.

Sub_112076_BayesData.csv came from file8.py on rivanna.

file2.py:
    Beta for test of Subject 112076...
    
file3.py:
    Beta for optimizing t and prior for subject 112076 
    for application to all Ss (idiographically).
    
file4.py:
    Explore fixing of t and playing with multiple priors 
    (similar to method in file3 but with fixed t).  All for sub
    112076 as beta.
    
file5_XXXXXXX.py:
    Data plan for generating a manuscript table for high activity
    S.  Uses model built in file4.  
    Made one for each high activity subject.
    Also has right-bounded decision analysis in it. (prior to prior estimation)
    
file6.py:
    Analysis of file5_xxx.py work.
    
file7_xxx.py:
    From file5_X adapted for highest.
    
file8.py:
    Analysis of file7_xxx.py (copy of file6)

bayes_test.py:
    Testing env. for code review the bayes modeling and
    generate the appendix for equations and simplify the code
    where possible.

NOTE: ERROR
NOTE: ERROR
Some of the 'plot_this_' outputs (csv) are not labeled correctly (e.g., has highest
in place of lowest) due to overwrites.   Similar issue on Rivanna for some of the
generating files.  Post 4-18-22, this will be corrected on Rivanna but not in ./ because
we are redoing all analysis.
